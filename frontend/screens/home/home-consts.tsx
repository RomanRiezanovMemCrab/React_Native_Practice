        description: `Detective Danny Rourke's daughter, Minnie, goes missing, causing his marriage to fall apart. While investigating a bank heist, Rourke encounters a mysterious man named Lev Dellrayne who possesses the power to control minds. Rourke finds a clue related to his daughter during the heist, leading him to a fortune-teller named Diana Cruz. Both Rourke and Cruz are revealed to be powerful hypnotists trained by a secretive government division. Rourke discovers that Dellrayne, someone else in disguise, is searching for a powerful weapon known as "Domino" which was stolen from the division. Rourke and Cruz escape to Mexico, where they learn more about the weapon and the truth about their own abilities. As Rourke uncovers more about his daughter's past and the connection to the division, he becomes determined to find her. The plot takes several twists and turns as Rourke and Cruz evade capture, uncover hidden identities, and encounter allies and enemies along the way. They discover the true nature of their daughter. The story builds up to a climactic confrontation between Rourke's family and the division, where their lives and freedom are at stake.—Frank Liesenborgs`,

        description: `Three time periods - young adolescence, mid-teen and young adult - in the life of black-American Chiron is presented. When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.—Huggo`,
